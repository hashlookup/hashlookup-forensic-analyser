# hashlookup-forensic-analyser

[![lint_python](https://github.com/hashlookup/hashlookup-forensic-analyser/actions/workflows/lint_python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hashlookup/hashlookup-forensic-analyser/actions/workflows/lint_python.yml)

Analyse a forensic target (such as a directory) to find and report files found and not found from [CIRCL hashlookup public service](https://circl.lu/services/hashlookup/) or the [Bloom filter](https://github.com/hashlookup/hashlookup-forensic-analyser#bloom-filter) from CIRCL hashlookup.
This tool can help a [digital forensic investigator](https://gist.github.com/adulau/e9e95fead4f32ac0fe725cb2a32fdb51) to know the context, origin of specific files during a digital forensic investigation.

The project is a component of the [hashlookup.io project](https://hashlookup.io/).

## Sample report

If you want to analyse a specific directory (in this case, a Kernel module directory), the following command be executed:

`python3 hashlookup-analyser.py  --bloomfilters ../hashlookup/hashlookup-full.bloom.1 --report -d /usr/lib/modules/5.11.0-41-generic/`

When executed with `--report`, a [summary report](./doc/sample-report/summary.md) in Markdown and a full [JSON](./doc/sample-report/full.json) file report are generated.

[A sample summary report is available](./doc/sample-report/summary.md).

## Bloom filter

If you don't want to share your lookups online and do faster lookup, hashlookup provides a [bloom filter to download](https://cra.circl.lu/hashlookup/hashlookup-full.bloom).

The file is around 1GB and can be stored locally in your home directory. `hashlookup-analyser` works in the same way, `--bloomfilters` option allows to specify the filename location of the bloom filter (one or more).
